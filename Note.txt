API Routers let us build RESTful endpoints with complete control over the response.
Think of it like building a Node + Express app.

All api route file must put inside app with the name:
app/[route]+api.ts



http://localhost:8081/hello
http://localhost:8081/api/comments      << can test with Bruno (for GET|POST) or website (for GET)

http://localhost:8081/api/comments/1    << Bruno (GET|PATCH|DELETE), will need to restart server if you have already run delete once (deleted it in memory), or choose another id.
    Request body if it's patch:
    {
      "text": "Updated comment"
    }
